# Student-Management
The user will be greeted with a login screen and upon successful login they will be shown a new window with options such as: enroll, un-enroll, change course, etc. 

- (The users will need to be created in MySQL first as MySQL validates the login info)
- I am planning on adding an admin window to perform tasks like: create schema, create table, updates, etc.

Will fill this out more thoroughly later.
